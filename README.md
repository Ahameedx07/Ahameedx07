# Visitor Counter with Animated Design

This is a simple, stylish **Visitor Counter** webpage that displays the number of visitors using a third-party visitor count service. The page features an animated, modern design with a glowing title and bouncing profile image.

## Features

- Live visitor count displayed via [profile-counter.glitch.me](https://profile-counter.glitch.me)
- Neon glow effect on the header text using CSS `text-shadow` animation
- Smooth hover scaling animation on the visitor count box for interactivity
- Bouncing animation on the profile image to add a dynamic feel
- Responsive and minimalistic design using Google Fonts (Orbitron)

## Animations Explained

- **Glow Animation:** The header text cycles between two glow states to create a neon light effect using `@keyframes glow`.
- **Hover Scale Animation:** When hovering over the visitor counter box, it smoothly scales up to 105% of its size.
- **Bounce Animation:** The profile image moves vertically up and down continuously to draw attention.
